# itsShiroharu.GitHub.io

This Repository contains my Personal [Website](https://shiroharu.eu.org). It mimics how Nginx Directory Listing Works. The website itself, does not use Nginx. It's fully Serverless and requires manual edit to modify the file listing.

## How it Works

It works like expected. It's a static website. So if you add more files or directories, you need to actually modify the ``index.html`` on each directory manually.
